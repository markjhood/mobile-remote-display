MIDP 3 Remote Display Discovery and Usage Demo
2010 Mobile World Congress

Agenda for planning meeting 2010-01-18 10:30am TPO / 6:30pm SFO

1) Intros

2) Questions about general user scenarios?  We are planning two demos:

   a) remote midlet display based on MIDP3 Auxiliary Display functionality
   b) LifeManager demo with external events

3) Discussion of resources and assignments for remote display based on
   attached implementation breakdown.  I am estimating 4 man-weeks of work for
   SFO and 6 man-weeks of work for TPO with a calendar deadline of February 14
   (27 days from now).

   a) JBlend internals team: 2 person-weeks TPO
   b) Network functionality teams: 2 person-weeks TPO; 1 person-week SFO
   c) Midlet programming team: 2 person-weeks TPO
   d) Auxiliary Display host: 1 person-week SFO
   e) Integration, testing, debugging: 2 person-weeks SFO

4) Discussion of external event generator for LifeManager demo.  The Zeemote
   controller will be used translate a button presses on the controller into
   standard MIDP3 key presses on the handset over the Bluetooth connection.

   We are requesting TPO to modify the JBlend AMS to listen for button presses
   from the Zeemote controller (a standard Bluetooth device) and generate
   JKT_EventData objects posted through AhEvents_post() broadcasts, as
   described in the MIDP3 Interface Reference:

   Issue: Will the AMS automatically be able to receive all key events, or
   does it have to be "active"? That is, if another native Windows Mobile
   application is open and active, will the AMS be able to receive key events?

   The exact event names and order will be provided later by Angus.  We don't
   have a resource estimate for this task yet, but it doesn't seem like it
   should take more than one man-week.
